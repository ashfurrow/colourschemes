# colourschemes
Some Xcode 4+ colour schemes I like

I don't strictly "know" quote unquote where some of these came from, so I'm not attaching a license to them. Use at your own (probably very very miniscule) risk. 

To use: just `git clone` this repo to the `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes` folder ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

```sh
git  clone https://github.com/ashfurrow/colourschemes.git --separate-git-dir /Users/ash/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
```
